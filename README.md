This is a simple 2D Space game I program in my free time! If you have any suggestions, feel free to drop them as issues!

## KNOWN ISSUES
- The camera doesn't directly focus on the ship. The faster the ship, the more it is off center.
- Pause Menu is focused on the ship, not the camera.
- Pause Menu is affected by camera zoom.

### Controls
Use the `arrow keys` to control the space ship.
- `F1`, `F2`: Zoom
- `F3`, `F4`: Change Simulation speed
- `TAB`: Switch camera between space objects
- `ESC`: Pause game
- `F11`: Toggle fullscreen
